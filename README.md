Does this sound familiar?

You forgot the FTP access and the admin is not available? You just want to revise a config-file on the live server or just upload some files? You look for the password, start the FTP client, download the file and upload it again. These time-consuming steps are now a thing of the past thanks to the File System Manager Extension for concrete5.

With this extension you are able to access your complete document info record. You can manage the entire file system of your hosting environment within the dashboard.

The following file operations are possible:

- Navigate in directories 
- Upload files 
- Delete files/directories 
- Move files/directories 
- Copy files/directories 
- Download files 
- Edit files 
- Create directories

But be careful! With great power comes great responsibility. Be aware that if you manipulate system files or delete them, they may shut down your entire website. Despite the simple and innovative handling, it is advisable to use this extension only with sufficient technical expertise. Furthermore, it is advisable to create regular backups. Some hosters e.g. offer the possibility of automated backups.

Thanks to a sophisticated authorization system, you can also use the extension with several users in various ways. In the concrete5 task authorizations you can determine who is allowed to do something and who is not allowed to do certain things.

The following permissions can be set:
- Permission to access the file sytem manager
- Permission to copy files/directories 
- Permission to create directories 
- Permission to edit files 
- Permission to move files/directories 
- Permission to rename files/directories 
- Permission to upload files/directories
- Permission to download files/directories
- Permission to copy files/directories 

Another highlight is the seamless integration. The dashboard side has the look and feel of concrete5. Just the right thing for every concrete5 fan.

Get it now! This small but powerful extension is a must-have for every concrete5 website.
